**After you install [Wordpress Ping Optimizer](http://mobioc.com/wordpress-ping-optimizer-plugin/):**
* When you create a new post, your blog will ping and notify all the ping services that it has been updated. This encourages search engines and different blog directories/services to index your updated blog properly.
* When you edit an existing post, it won't send any unnecessary ping to ping services and saves your blog from getting banned by such services.
* When you post a future post by editing the time stamp, it will ping only when your post appears in future. It won't unnecessarily ping many times when you schedule posts as WordPress does by default.
* Works on all modern browsers.
* Work With all the cache plugins.
* Simple configuration.
